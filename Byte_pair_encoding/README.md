In this section, i am going to show you how to train , use your own custom BPE tokenizer.

this section contains
  1. implement BPE algorithm
  2. use huggingface library to train and use tokenizer with our custom dataset
  3. use sentencepiece library to train and use tokenizer with our custom dataset

so lets take a look into it one by one.
# 1 implement BPE alogrithm
  just open bpq_alogrithm.ipynb and you will get each line explaination involved<br>
